# TripTrackWPFWebBrowser

Similar to this project https://github.com/thurst0/TripTrackerASPWebApp - this was another test of a web app to track & reward students for getting to school via alternative trasporotation methods.

This was a little more traditional C# application, but written using the WPF web browser.  One of the downsides of this solultion was that it could only be accessed on a windows based machine, and the database layer was not accessible via HTTP calls.

The database is Microsoft SQL Server.
